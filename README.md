# 10 years of Shannon Airport Weather Data
---

For my Interactive Frontent Development project I've created a beautifuly interactive data dashboard
that uses real life data provided by data.gov.ie. Out of personal interest, I based this project
on the historial weather data of Shannon airport which is my preferred and closest airport to me.


### UX
---

This website is for travel enthusists, aviation specailists and climate scientist who are 
curious about different airports around the world, Shannon Airport being the destination this time.

As a traveler, I want to find weather information such as rainfull, sunlight and average temperate.
I want to be able to filter between years and months in order to be able to make the best possible desicon
when deciding which airport to travel to. 

As an aviation specailist, I may have been assisgned a new route and interested in the location
and its data. As weather plays a huge factor in avaiation I want to learn more about this location
and how it might affect my work. I want to review historial data to see what to expect but to also
review times when things were not as usual.

As a climate scientist I want to be able to review data in a more digestable form rather than
reading plain data. I need to see historial data in order to research the changing climate. I
want to see everything as a whole, but also filter to get specfic on certain data types and times
to create corrilations with other parts of their research into the cliemate.


### Features

##### Existing Features
- The navigation bar is responsive even though this is a single page site. Using a **scroll spy** it
separates each graph and moves the user to each section and when scrolling the section block will darken in the navigation bar option. 

- A **reset buttom** resides in the sticky navivation bar allowing users to easily reset charts. 

- **Google Maps API** for Shannon Airport has been included just below the nav bar due to its relevantcy
to the overall site and the users that will be visiting will likely use it while navigating the site.

- After the desciption a **filter button that toggles between months** is above two bar charts
which makes for easy data digestion. 

- Below the button are **two Bar Charts which showcase total rainfall and total sunlight hours**
over a 10 year period.

- Following that is another **filter button**, this time for year. 

- The graph right of that displays a **scatter plot** showcasing a highest gusts of wind recorded every month 
for each year. Using multicolor it helps diferenate between the data and by hovering over a dot you can
see the year.

- Next up is a **graph of the average air temperate**. Using a **custom reducer in the js** it displays
the average air temperate for each month. 

- To the left of the graph another year selector is in place to help the user toggle between the years.

- Last is a footer with a link to my github.
